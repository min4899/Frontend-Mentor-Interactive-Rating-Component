## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Javascript

### What I learned

I learned how to use Javascript to modify parts of the HTML frontend. Used functions like "document.getElementsByName" and "document.getElementsById" to retrieve certain elements and edit their properties.
I also learned about different types of inputs for HTML. This project specifically used radio type inputs for the rating functionality. We then use JavaScript to retrieve which radio button was selected and process the corresponding value.

```js
var ele = document.getElementsByName("rating");

let selectedRating;
for (let i = 0; i < ele.length; i++) {
  if (ele[i].checked) {
    selectedRating = ele[i].value;
    break;
  }
}
```

### Continued development

I'd like to focus on responsive layouts for different screens for future projects. This project had designs that showed slight changes to layouts between 375px and 1440 px that I couldn't manage to implement perfectly. 
I'd also like to learn how to properly change panels and hiding/showing different content. My implementation just had 2 divs for the 2 different states. After submitting a rating, the 1st state div would be set to `display: none` while the 2nd would set to `display: flex`.
I feel like there's a better solution, but this was the best I could think of at the time.
